# python_workout_assistant
This program tracks the users current weights/workout routines by connecting to google calendar and google sheets using each of their APIs. When the program is run, it will ask the user to enter the muscle groups they are focusing on for that day, and will then collect the most recent weights associated with that muscle from the google sheet and display these values to the user. The user can choose to use the weight that is displayed or enter their own if they want to increase/decrease, and this new weight it what will be displayed the next time the program is run. The idea was the user would be able to both track their progress and remember of which muscle groups they have already exercised that week, etc.
